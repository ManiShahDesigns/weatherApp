# weatherApp
This is a weather app which I have made with openweathermap.org's API

There are two classes in this app, one for fetching the data from opeweathermap.org and another one for adding it to the user interface. 
The weather class has the ES7 async/await functionality which makes working with Promise easier. 
This app is not mobile responsive as I mainly made it to learn how to work with APIs and did not focus on its responsiveness.
